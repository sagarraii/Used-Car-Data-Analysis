**Project Title: Used Car Data Analysis**

**Description:**

This project involves a comprehensive data analysis of a used car dataset to uncover key insights and trends that can assist buyers, sellers, and dealerships in making informed decisions. The goal is to understand how various features—such as car brand, model, age, mileage, fuel type, transmission, engine size, and location—affect the resale value of used cars.

**Objectives:**

* Analyze and clean raw used car sales data
* Identify key features influencing car prices
* Explore pricing trends across different brands, fuel types, and locations
* Detect outliers and inconsistencies in pricing
* Generate visualizations to communicate patterns and correlations
* Prepare the data for potential predictive modeling (price prediction)

**Key Tasks Performed:**

1. **Data Collection & Importing:**

   * Imported a structured dataset containing thousands of used car listings.
   * Checked for duplicates, missing values, and irrelevant entries.

2. **Data Cleaning:**

   * Handled missing values by either removing or imputing based on context.
   * Converted string-formatted numerical values to proper numeric formats (e.g., price, mileage).
   * Normalized inconsistent labels (e.g., fuel types like "Petrol" vs "petrol").
   * Removed outliers using IQR and Z-score methods for mileage and price.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**

   * Analyzed price distribution across car brands and models.
   * Studied the impact of mileage, age, and engine size on pricing.
   * Explored how fuel type and transmission influence resale value.
   * Used correlation matrices to detect multicollinearity between variables.

4. **Visualization:**

   * Used matplotlib and seaborn to create:

     * Histograms and boxplots for price and mileage distribution
     * Bar charts comparing average price across brands and fuel types
     * Scatter plots showing relationships between mileage, age, and price

5. **Findings:**

   * Newer cars with lower mileage and larger engines tend to command higher prices.
   * Diesel cars showed better resale value in certain regions.
   * Automatic transmission was more expensive on average than manual.
   * Certain brands like BMW and Audi had high depreciation, while Toyota and Honda retained value better.

6. **Next Steps (optional):**

   * The cleaned and analyzed data can be used to build a regression model to predict used car prices.
   * Potential to integrate geolocation and time-based data for dynamic pricing analysis.

**Tools & Libraries Used:**

* Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
* Jupyter Notebook
* Basic statistical techniques (IQR, correlation, Z-score)

**Conclusion:**

This project demonstrates how exploratory data analysis can reveal meaningful insights from real-world datasets. It sets the foundation for building a price prediction model and can support better decision-making in the used car market.
